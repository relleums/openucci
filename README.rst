In the early 2000s, the company Compagnucci S.p.a. released
an 1/8th scale radio controlled on road model car. On my opininon,
the car was an engineerging master piece. The quality of its black
chassis plastic material was outstanding. Although I have to admit
that Compagnucci did not endure the necessary iterations to remove
the car from some flaws. If you did not realize it yet, I am
kind of a fan. I learned RC car driving on this car. The electric
version was not quick by any means. Today, but also back then, many
drivers dismissed the Compagnucci for this reason. It is as far away
from a `basher' RC car as one can be. This is why I like it.
It is just a pleasent experience to drive the car.

Anyhow, in this repository I collect 3D drawings for some replacement
parts which I desigend. They are meant for 3D printing.

Rims

A true eyecatcher of the Compagnucci were its rims which were screwed
together by 8pcs ``M2`` bolts. Unfortunately, the disk in these rims
often broke. Here is an alternative disk I designed which is star shaped.
